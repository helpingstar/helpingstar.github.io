# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 10, 2026**

Dayloader ("the App", "we", "our") is committed to protecting user privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how we handle your data.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 App Data (Stored Locally)
The App stores your planning data (such as categories, tasks, routines, and completion history) locally on your device. We do not automatically collect or transmit this app data to external servers.

### 1.2 Feedback Submissions (Sent Only When You Choose to Send Feedback)
If you choose to use the feedback feature, you may voluntarily provide:
- **Contact email address** (to receive a response)
- **Message content**

When you submit feedback, the App also includes limited **technical information** to help us troubleshoot issues and prevent duplicate submissions:
- **App identifier** (e.g., app package/app ID)
- **App version** (version name and version code)
- **Device model**
- **Operating system version**
- **Locale/language**
- **Client-generated ID** (a randomly generated identifier used to deduplicate feedback submissions; it is **not** linked to an account)

We use feedback information only to respond to your inquiry, troubleshoot, and prevent duplicate feedback submissions.

---

## 2. Data Storage (App Data)

All planning data you enter into the App (such as categories, tasks, routines, and completion history) is stored locally on your device. We do not transmit this app data to external servers.

---

## 3. Backup and Restore

The App provides a backup and restore feature. Backup files are saved to the location you choose on your device and are created only when you explicitly initiate the process. No app data is sent to external servers during backup or restore.

**Important:** Backup files are not encrypted. Avoid storing backup files in locations accessible to others. If you share or sync backup files through external services (e.g., cloud storage), those services' privacy policies apply.

---

## 4. Feedback and Inquiries

When you use the feedback feature, the information described in Section 1.2 (including your email address, message content, and technical metadata) is transmitted to our support backend hosted on **Supabase**. This data is used solely for:
- responding to your inquiry,
- troubleshooting, and
- preventing duplicate feedback submissions.

We do not use feedback data for marketing, analytics, or advertising.

---

## 5. Data Retention and Deletion

Feedback submissions (including contact email, message content, and technical metadata) are retained only as long as necessary to resolve your inquiry and handle duplicate-submission prevention.

You may request deletion of your feedback submission at any time by contacting us at the email address below.

---

## 6. Third-Party Services

The App does not use third-party analytics tools, advertising services, or tracking technologies.

However, we use **Supabase** as an infrastructure provider to receive and store feedback submissions for support purposes only.

---

## 7. Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. The App does not automatically collect personal information, and the feedback feature requires voluntary input.

---

## 8. Security

App data is stored locally on your device and protected by your device's operating system security.

Feedback data is transmitted over a secure connection and stored in our support backend (Supabase) for the limited purposes described in this policy.

---

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

If this policy is updated, we will notify you through the App or this page prior to the changes taking effect.
